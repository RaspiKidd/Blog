  <h1 class="headline" itemprop="headline">Digital Skills Shortage</h1>
  <section class="body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Many of you probably seen the BBC News article about the digital skills shortage that was published yesterday. This is something close to our hearts at RaspiKidd and micro:mag.</p>
<p>A lot of things mentioned in the article is why we do what we do at RaspiKidd and <a href="https://micromag.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro:mag</a></p>
<p>People going off to study digital courses at uni whether this is Software development, engineering or other IT-related courses and finding the materials to be outdated. I did exactly this after spending a good few years out of education and self-teaching digital skills and keeping up with technology I decided to go back to uni to do a masters in Computing which I never completed as I saw it as a waste of time as I was getting taught skills and programming languages that werenâ€™t used within the industry.</p>
<p>This is partly why RaspiKidd and micro:mag were created as I wanted to encourage kids, teachers and parents to find relevant materials to cater to kids that have a passion for IT and digital making. Most recently I got asked to lead <a href="https://dundeebots.uk/">DundeeBots</a> a project funded by the <a href="https://www.theiet.org/">IET</a>(Institution of Engineering and Technology) and <a href="https://www.imeche.org/">IMechE</a> (Institution of Mechanical Engineers) to create robotics kits and learning resources to use within Dundee schools and community groups to encourage kids into engineering and coding.</p>
<p>With Dundee being the tech capital of Scotland I would be interested to speak to local IT and Digital companies on how we could bridge this gap and encourage more kids to get excited about technology.</p>
<p>Read the full BBC article <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56479304?fbclid=IwAR06hw1git336IgvpZFz1bMCnqqMRCYI0cCpPiJdxqWPCndFU9yBdVkRJdo">here</a></p>
