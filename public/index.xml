      <description>Connect and code electronics instantly The jacdac is a modular electronics kit for the BBC micro:bit and soon-to-be other platforms like the Raspberry pi.
We received the jacdac starter kit A for this review.
Starter kit A contains:
 The jacdac adapter for the micro:bit v2 1 x Slider 1 x Rotary Button 1x RGB Ring 2 x Keycap Buttons 1 x Magnet Sensor 1 x Hub 1 x Light Sensor 5 x Cables to connect the modules to the jacdac  Within 5 minutes of connecting the jacdac to the micro:bit, loading the MakeCode editor and adding the jacdac extension Kerry realised this was no ordinary micro:bit add-on.</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi for Dummies Book Review</title>
      <link>https://blog.raspikidd.com/post/raspberrypiforddummiesreview/</link>

      <description>Written by Sean McManus and Mike Cook Raspberry Pi for dummies is a great book for anyone getting started with Raspberry Pi. No matter what version of Raspberry Pi they have, they will be up and running quickly.
One thing I love about this book is that you do not need to read it from cover to cover. You can dip in and out of the chapters depending on what you want to learn/use your Raspberry Pi for.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Marty is created by Robotical a small educational robotics company in Edinburgh Scotland founded by Dr Alexander Enoch in 2016. His main mission at the time was to develop a robot for his niece to code and make programming more like child&amp;rsquo;s play.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Micro:bit Temperature Sensor</title>

      <guid>https://blog.raspikidd.com/post/microbit-temperature-sensor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week in micro:bit Monday we will be looking at the temperature sensor to detect what the temperature is and display it on the LED matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do this indoors tethered to your computer by the USB cable or why not attach a battery pack and take it outdoors and see what the difference in temperature is!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>micro:bit Pins</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we will take a look at what we can do with the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins. You can do a lot of things using the pins at the bottom of the micro:bit including using touch, connecting them to tinfoil, fruit, headphones or other electronic components using crocodile clips. You can even use them with add-on boards like motor controllers, LED screens and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>micro:bit Light Sensor</title>
      <link>https://blog.raspikidd.com/post/microbit-light-sensor/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.raspikidd.com/post/microbit-light-sensor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week in micro:bit Monday we are going to discover how to use the micro:bit to detect light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The micro:bit doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a light sensor built in, but we can use the LED matrix to detect how much light there is in a room. This can be then used to make a night light, or a light for the front of a scooter or bike or even just attached to you and it will turn on when it starts to get dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within this post we are going to get to know what we can do with the LED matrix on the front of the micro:bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will include code for the MakeCode, EduBlocks and microPython editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets get started!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another micro:bit Monday blog post. This week we are going to look at creating a simple compass which shows the bearing from magnetic North in degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built-in compass sensor is called a magnetometer. This can be used to measure the Earths magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how to code it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>micro:bit Accelerometer</title>

      <guid>https://blog.raspikidd.com/post/microbit-accelerometer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week we are going to look at the accelerometer. The accelerometer allows us to use the micro:bit to detect movement, whether this is counting steps, detecting if someone or something is falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to use the accelerometer, either through the shake function or the acceleration block, We will be consentrating on the accelerometer block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the code!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Many of you probably seen the BBC News article about the digital skills shortage that was published yesterday. This is something close to our hearts at RaspiKidd and micro:mag.
A lot of things mentioned in the article is why we do what we do at RaspiKidd and micro:mag
People going off to study digital courses at uni whether this is Software development, engineering or other IT-related courses and finding the materials to be outdated.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-a-year-we-have-all-had&#34;&gt;What a year we have all had!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at RaspiKidd it&amp;rsquo;s been a real rollercoaster. Started in January with running a 2-day robotics workshop within the V&amp;amp;A Dundee to then supporting a group of high school children develop their idea within the school&amp;rsquo;s design jam again within the V&amp;amp;A Dundee. At this point, I was also in talks with various people and organisations on running more activities throughout the year. Well, low and behold the world as we knew it then changed in March with the whole world pretty much going into lockdown due to Covid19 no more face to face meetings or workshops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
