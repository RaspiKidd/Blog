The jacdac is a modular electronics kit for the BBC micro:bit and soon-to-be other platforms like the Raspberry pi.

We received the jacdac starter kit A for this review.

Starter kit A contains:

* The jacdac adapter for the micro:bit v2
* 1 x Slider
* 1 x Rotary Button
* 1x RGB Ring
* 2 x Keycap Buttons
* 1 x Magnet Sensor
* 1 x Hub
* 1 x Light Sensor
* 5 x Cables to connect the modules to the jacdac

Within 5 minutes of connecting the jacdac to the micro:bit, loading the MakeCode editor and adding the jacdac extension Kerry realised this was no ordinary micro:bit add-on. Every module connected to the jacdac appears within the MakeCode simulator and can be controlled within the simulator.

The modules can also be added to the simulator manually meaning you don't need to have the jacdac and all the modules to get started coding. Kerry would still highly recommend picking up the jacdac though as she has had so much fun playing about the jacdac and the modules while writing this review. Who doesn't love playing with blinking lights and manipulating sound with a slider?

One thing to note: If you are interested in picking up the jacdac, it only works with the micro:bit v2. This is down to the way the jacdac is developed with it being an optional MakeCode extension in static TypeScript and requiring more flash and RAM(Random Access Memory) as a result.

This is an amazing unique micro:bit add-on with how it connects to the MakeCode simulator. I have had a lot of fun playing with the jacdac over the last two weeks and can't wait to see where they go next with the jacdac. Now that I have finished the review, I will be letting Code Club get their hands on it and see what they can make!
