## Installing Mu On Linux

Each Linux distro is a bit different, so for this guide, I am going to focus on Ubuntu.

1. Open up a Terminal window.
2. Mu requires Python3. You can check and see if you have Python3 installed by typing ```python3 --version``` If nothing is displayed then type ```sudo apt install python3``` to install Python3.
3. You also need pip3 installed type ```pip3 --version``` If it shows nothing you need to install pip3 by typing ```sudo apt install python3-pip```
4. Finally to install Mu type ```pip3 install mu_editor```
5. You can now run Mu from the command line by typing ```Mu```
